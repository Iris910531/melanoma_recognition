# Investigation of Intelligent Recognition of Melanoma Based on Systematic Image Feature Extraction


## Introduction

This is my thesis project I made in my junior year, focusing on feature extraction from images and model training using Python. This research identified key features for distinguishing melanoma, namely color and texture. This not only narrows down the scope for subsequent melanoma research but also provides the public with clearer criteria for melanoma identification, facilitating early treatment and improving survival rates.

## Data Source
This study utilized a variety of datasets for melanoma images: 40 from the PH2 dataset [1], 70 from MED-NODE [2], 162 from the ISIC Challenge [3], 584 from Kaggle [4], and 32,042 non-melanoma images, totaling 856 melanoma images and 32,042 non-melanoma images.
